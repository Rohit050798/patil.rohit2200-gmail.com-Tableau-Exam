**Join types**
In general, there are four types of joins that you can use in Tableau: inner, left, right, and full outer. If you aren't sure what join type you want to use to combine data from multiple tables, you should use relationships.

**1.Inner Join**
When you use an inner join to combine tables, the result is a table that contains values that have matches in both tables.

When a value doesn't match across both tables, it is dropped entirely.

**Left Join**
When you use a left join to combine tables, the result is a table that contains all values from the left table and corresponding matches from the right table.

When a value in the left table doesn't have a corresponding match in the right table, you see a null value in the data grid.


**Right Join**
When you use a right join to combine tables, the result is a table that contains all values from the right table and corresponding matches from the left table.

When a value in the right table doesn't have a corresponding match in the left table, you see a null value in the data grid.


**Full Join**
When you use a full outer join to combine tables, the result is a table that contains all values from both tables.

When a value from either table doesn't have a match with the other table, you see a null value in the data grid
