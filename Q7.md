A table calculation is a transformation you apply to the values in a visualization. Table calculations are a special type of calculated field that computes on the local data in Tableau. They are calculated based on what is currently in the visualization and do not consider any measures or dimensions that are filtered out of the visualization.

**Step 1: Build the visualization**

Open Tableau and connect to the Sample-Superstore saved data source.

Navigate to a new worksheet.

From the Data pane, under Dimensions, drag Order Date to the Rows shelf.

The dimension updates to YEAR(Order Date).

On the Rows shelf, right-click YEAR(Order Date) and select Quarter.

On the Rows shelf, click the + icon on QUARTER(Order Date).

MONTH(Order Date) is added to the shelf.

From the Data pane, under Dimensions, drag Order Date to the Columns shelf.

The dimension updates to YEAR(Order Date) again.

From the Data pane, under Measures, drag Sales to Text on the Marks card.



**Step 2: Add the table calculation**

On the Marks card, right-click SUM(Sales) and select Add Table Calculation.

In the Table Calculation dialog box that opens, do the following:

For Calculation Type: select Difference From.

For more information about the types of table calculations you can use in Tableau, and how you can configure them, see Table Calculation Types.

For Compute Using, select Table (across).

For more information about these options, see The basics: addressing and partitioning section.

Note that as you select how to compute the calculation, the visualization updates with visual indicators to guide you.

When finished, click the X in the top corner of the Table Calculation dialog box to exit it.

The calculation is applied to the values in the visualization.
